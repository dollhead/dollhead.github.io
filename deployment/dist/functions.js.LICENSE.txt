     * 
     * Synaptic is a javascript neural network library for node.js and the browser, its generalized
     * algorithm is architecture-free, so you can build and train basically any type of first order
     * or even second order neural network architectures.
     * 
     * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network
     * 
     * The library includes a few built-in architectures like multilayer perceptrons, multilayer
     * long-short term memory networks (LSTM) or liquid state machines, and a trainer capable of
     * training any given network, and includes built-in training tasks/tests like solving an XOR,
     * passing a Distracted Sequence Recall test or an Embeded Reber Grammar test.
     * 
     * The algorithm implemented by this library has been taken from Derek D. Monner's paper:
     * 
     * 
     * A generalized LSTM-like training algorithm for second-order recurrent neural networks
     * http://www.overcomplete.net/papers/nn2012.pdf
     * 
     * There are references to the equations in that paper commented through the source code.
